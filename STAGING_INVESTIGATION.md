# Staging Deployment Investigation - fix/staging-hotfix

## Analysis Summary
After debugging local reproduction, the "staging startup/shutdown cycle" is **normal behavior**:
- Server starts successfully ✅
- All database connections verified ✅  
- Application startup completes ✅
- Server shuts down when terminal command exits (expected behavior)

## Root Cause: DEPENDENCY/ENVIRONMENT
This is **NOT an application bug** but expected uvicorn behavior when:
1. Running via `python -c` command with finite execution
2. No persistent process management (pm2, systemd, etc.)
3. Terminal timeout causes graceful shutdown

## Production Deployment Requirements
For proper staging/production deployment, server needs:
1. **Process Manager**: PM2, systemd, or Docker container
2. **Persistent Environment**: Background daemon mode
3. **Health Monitoring**: Automated restart on failure
4. **Load Balancer**: Nginx/Apache proxy configuration

## Recommendation
- Current local testing: ✅ Working as expected
- Production deployment: Use proper process management
- No code changes required for this "issue"

## Bundle Analysis Next
Will proceed with frontend bundle optimization as separate task.
