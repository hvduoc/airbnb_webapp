## 🎪 Beginner's Workflow

**Week 1-2: Learn these 3 only**
1. 🚀 **Full Development Startup**
2. 📋 **AI: List Tasks** 
3. 🏁 **End Development Session**

**Week 3+: Add when needed**
4. 🏥 **AI: Health Check** (when errors)
5. ⚡ **Quick: Import Test** (when import issues)

## 🔍 Task Search Tips

**Instead of scrolling through 13 tasks:**

| Want to... | Type in search |
|------------|----------------|
| Start working | "startup" or "full" |
| See what to do | "list" or "tasks" |
| Fix problems | "health" or "check" |
| Test something | "import" or "quick" |
| Finish work | "end" or "session" |

## 🎯 Pro Tips

### ✅ **Do This:**
- Start day with F5 (Full Startup)
- Use "list" task when stuck
- End with "End Session" task
- Search by keywords, don't scroll

### ❌ **Don't Do This:**  
- Try to memorize all 13 tasks
- Use advanced tasks without understanding
- Skip End Session (loses context)
- Run multiple tasks simultaneously

## 🏆 Success Metrics

**You're using tasks correctly if:**
- ✅ You remember F5 for startup
- ✅ You can find tasks by typing keywords
- ✅ You use 3-4 tasks per day maximum
- ✅ You don't feel overwhelmed by options

**Congratulations! You've mastered the VS Code task system!** 🎉
