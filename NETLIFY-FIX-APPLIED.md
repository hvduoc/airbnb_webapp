# ✅ NETLIFY FIX APPLIED - Ready for Redeploy

## 🎯 **ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Problem:** Netlify was looking for `brain-ui/brain-ui/dist` (duplicate path)
**Cause:** Incorrect `publish` path in netlify.toml
**Solution:** Changed `publish = "brain-ui/dist"` → `publish = "dist"`

---

## 📤 **CHANGES PUSHED TO GITHUB**

**Fixed File:** `netlify.toml`
```toml
[build]
  base = "brain-ui"          # Working directory
  command = "npm run build"  # Build command  
  publish = "dist"           # Publish from brain-ui/dist (not brain-ui/brain-ui/dist)
```

**Commit:** `2aef893 - Fix netlify.toml publish path - remove duplicate brain-ui`
